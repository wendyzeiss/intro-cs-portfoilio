          The Interactive Game project was the most challenging assignment that I completed during this class, and it tested my problem-solving skills.
          The most challenging aspect of the project was also the area where I showed the most growth.
          The challenging part was designing a game that met all of the requirements in the project rubric.
          Specifically, I struggled with the requirement to include an instance of sprites colliding with each other (collide, displace, bounce, or bounceOff).
          The concept of my game was that the squirrel needed to catch apples that were falling from the sky, and if the squirrel misses, and, when one of the apples touches the ground, the game is over.
          I thought it would be simple to include a collision in my game, but my game used the “istouching” command to track points. When I tried to add a collision, it kept making my game get stuck.
          I spent hours researching possible solutions and testing them, but nothing fixed the problem.
          Then, I tried adding an element that was unrelated to the game (a flower) and created an effect where the flower would jiggle if the apple touched the flower.
          However, I still had the same problem when I added the collision between the flower and the apple.
          After many days and hours of trying different things, I thought of a solution: I incorporated the collision into the end of the game.
          I created an invisible box on the ground, and then I added a sprite collision using the apple and the invisible ground that happened when the game ended.
          Many times, I wanted to give up on my game and just take the loss of points for not including the collision, but I kept pushing myself to think of a solution.
          I kept running different ideas through my head and then trying them.
          It was difficult and sometimes frustrating to test because I had to play the game each time I changed the code to see what would happen.
          I was proud of myself for using my skills to create an invisible element to solve my problem and meet the project requirement.

    Additionally, this project was challenging because I needed to work on it during the busiest week of my entire summer.
    At the beginning of the week, I was participating in the LA County Junior Lifeguards program, training for my new job as a lifeguard, and going to swim practice at night.
    So, I needed to work on the assignments and projects every night when I got home at 8PM. Then, Thursday-Sunday, I participated in two very important swim meets.
    I worked on my project between prelims and finals at the pool and at night when I got home from the meets.
    I did this even though I was exhausted and preoccupied preparing for the swim meet. I think this showed my strong work ethic and time management skills.
    I was proud of myself for pushing through and doing my absolute best on the project even though I was exhausted and just wanted to focus on performing well at my swim meets.

<p>Knowing what I know now and reviewing what I lost points for, I would start with the rubric and work backwards.
    One of the elements that I lost points for was not having a clear way to “win” the game.
    In my mind, I pictured the game being played by two people, and the person with the higher amount of points was the winner.
    However, that was not sufficient to receive full credit for the rubric.
    I thought it was more fun if the game just continued on, and the apples fell faster and faster.
    However, knowing what I know now, I would design my entire game around the requirements of the rubric and not worry whether the game was fun or interesting to me.
    I would try to think of game design that made it easier to include a way to “win” and a collision.
    I also lost points for not making my draw loop concise enough, so I would focus on that as well.
