          The Turtle Programming Scene is an example of my best work because it highlights my creativity, adaptability, and knowledge of coding with functions.
          The wave, shark fin, and sea star make me feel the most proud because they change each time the code is run and show my ability to turn simple code into complex patterns and designs.
          This helps my work stand out.
          </p>
          <p>I found the background of this scene to be easy to do because I already had the knowledge from previous lessons so I just had to adapt the code to meet my parameters for my design. The details of this design such as the starfish and shark fin were difficult to create because we had not learned a coding pattern that would work to make either of the designs previously so I had to continue testing out different types of code and parameters to fit my idea for the design.
          I used my knowledge of angles and arc lengths to make the waves and shark fin, as well as the sea star.
          In order to make the sun and sunbeams I used my knowledge of eclipses and the skills I learned on colors and transparency.
