         The skills I have learned in this class are the basis of coding in java script that can be used to code games, websites, quizzes, and apps.
         I could use these skills to help aid my presentations in other classes and could be used to create prototypes for projects.
         I currently have no goals related to computer science, as my goals are more focused on swimming.

         However, I did learn that I need to prioritize directions over creativity and the importance of working backwards.
         I could apply these strategies to other classes.
         Coding some of the elements in gameLab, such as collisions, is still an area of weakness for me but I could continue to get better at this by doing more practice.
