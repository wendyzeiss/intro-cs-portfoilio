          Hi! My name is Wendy, and I am a competitive swimmer. Swimming is my main passion in life, and I hope to swim competitively in college. I also enjoy cheerleading. Charli XCX is one of my favorite singers. "Gossip Girl" and "The Summer I Turned Pretty" are two of my favorite shows to watch.

This page is a portfolio dedicated to my work in computer science. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my knowledge and skills related to computer science. In this course, I was introduced to the introductory concepts of Computer Science and Computer Programming. I learned how computer science is a part of everyday life, and I learned about the uses and limitations of computer science, including AI. I learned the basic elements of programming and created my own websites and programs using HTML, CSS, and Code.org. Some of the projects I completed included creating a scene using turtle programming, developing a concept for a new app, making a game, and designing two websites.
